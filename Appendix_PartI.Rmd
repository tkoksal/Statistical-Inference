This code for the function `plot_sample_means()` was originally adopted from an R-bloggers article titled [Using R for Introductory Statistics 6, Simulations][1] and modified accordingly to the needs of this project assignment.

This function plots 2 distributions side by side for 100 and 1000 simulations, respectively. User provided input `f_sample` to the function accepts built in R distributions such as `runif`, `rbinom`, `rpois`, etc.  (in our case `rexp`). The input `n` is for the sample size; `lambda` for the rate parameter of the exponential distribution; `nosim100` and `nosim1000` for the number of simulations (number of samples to be drawn): 100 and 1000, respectively; `ylim` for the upper limit of the y-axis; `a` and `b` for the lower and upper limits (on the x-axis) of the theoretical normal distribution; and `title` for the title of the plot.
